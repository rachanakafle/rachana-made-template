## Title

Correlation Analysis: COVID-19 Total Cases and Deaths in Asian and European Countries
## Main Question

If a country has higher COVID-19 cases, will it always have higher deaths?

## Description

In this project, I will focus on a dataset related to COVID-19 cases in Asia and Europe. I'll analyze whether countries with more COVID-19 cases also have more deaths cases. The aim is to determine whether a strong correlation exists between the number of COVID-19 cases and the associated death cases.

## Datasources
### Datasource1: Asia Covid 19 cases
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/asia-covid-19-cases-updated-10-oct-21/data
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/asia-covid-19-cases-updated-10-oct-21?resource=download&select=AsiaCases_.csv
* Data Type: CSV
### Datasource2: Covid-19 in Europe 
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandhuh/latest-covid19-data-of-european-countries
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandhuh/latest-covid19-data-of-european-countries?select=europe_covid.csv
* Data Type: CSV

These datasets contain columns like Country, Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, Total Cases/1 mil population, Death/1 mil population, Total Tests, Tests/1 mil population, and Population for both Asia and Europe COVID-19 dataset.
